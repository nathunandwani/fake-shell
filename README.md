# fake-shell
Fake shell to accommodate automated commands if a TTY shell cannot be acquired through HTTP PUT-enabled directory in a browser. I made this to automate command execution specifically on SickOS 1.2 from Vulnhub because I couldn't get a TTY shell during my initial information gathering. (Although I did get one after a few tries. lol)
